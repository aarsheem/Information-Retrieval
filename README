Dependencies:

This code uses JSON-java library(ver 20200518) to read json file. can be found by searching the Maven repository for
groupId "org.json" and artifactId "json".
For example: https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.json%20AND%20a:json&core=gav
Github repo: https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java


Building the Code:

This code was tested in IntelliJ IDE, and should run on importing the Project folder. Note that json input file
should be inside Project/data folder.


Running the Code:
The code takes three command line arguments.
HW2: First one should be one of "build","vector","bm25","mercer" or "dirichlet".
HW4: First one should be case "build", "od1", "uw", "sum", "and", "or", or "max".
Second one should be "true" or "false", based on if you would like to do the
compression or not. Third argument should be the name of json file

The "build" argument builds the inverted index file and saves it.
